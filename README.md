# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the machine learning project for the Customer Churn Prediction assignment at Sunbase.

## Assignment Description

At Sunbase, customer satisfaction is a priority. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical customer data. As a Machine Learning Intern, your task is to follow the outlined guidelines and responsibilities to create and deploy this model.

## Objective

Develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn using a standard machine learning project pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, optimization, and deployment.

## Data

The dataset provided is in CSV format and contains historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration.
- Handle missing data and outliers.
- Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Generate relevant features from the dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
- Apply feature scaling or normalization if necessary.

### 3. Model Building

- Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks).
- Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### 4. Model Optimization

- Fine-tune the model parameters to improve predictive performance.
- Explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

### 5. Model Deployment

- Deploy the model into a production-like environment (development environment simulation).
- Ensure the model can take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions.

## Deliverables

1. Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your code.
2. A brief report summarizing your approach, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection decisions.
3. Model performance metrics and visualizations.

## Additional Information

- Python and relevant machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch are encouraged for implementation.
- The assignment assesses skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assessment will be based on:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Creativity and effectiveness of feature engineering.
- Model selection and optimization.
- Model deployment and integration.
- Clarity and organization of your code.
- Documentation and reporting of your work.

## Note

This assignment evaluates your skills and approach to a real-world machine learning problem, aligning with the responsibilities of a Machine Learning Engineer at Sunbase. Good luck with your project, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
