## Introduction

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The project follows a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. By understanding customer behavior and predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is available in CSV format and is included in the repository.

## Project Pipeline

The project is divided into several phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and explore the dataset, handle missing data and outliers, and prepare the data for machine learning.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Generate relevant features from the dataset to improve model prediction accuracy.
3. **Model Building**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, train and validate the selected model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
4. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its predictive performance.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a production-like environment, allowing it to take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to understand the project code and workflow.

## Usage

To use the customer churn prediction model:

1. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Fill in the customer details in the form and click the "Predict Churn" button.
4. The app will display the churn prediction result.

## Deployment

The customer churn prediction model can be deployed using various methods:

- Locally: The Flask app provides a simple way to run the model locally on your machine.
- GitHub Pages: You can deploy the front-end part of the app to GitHub Pages for easy access.
- Cloud Services: Platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure can be used for more advanced deployments.
